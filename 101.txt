101 Dalmatians tells the story of Pongo and Perdita, two loyal dalmatians living happily with their owners, Roger and Anita. Their peaceful life changes when Cruella de Vil, a wealthy woman obsessed with fashion, becomes interested in their puppies. She wants their spotted fur for a coat, and she will do anything to get it. After Pongo and Perdita have a litter of beautiful puppies, Cruella sends her henchmen to steal them, leaving the family heartbroken and desperate for answers.

Pongo and Perdita decide they cannot wait for humans, so they begin their own rescue mission. They use the "Twilight Bark," a dog-to-dog communication signal, to spread the news across the countryside. With help from other animals, they discover that Cruella has kidnapped not just their puppies, but dozens more. She is keeping ninety-nine dalmatian puppies hidden in an old mansion, planning to turn all of them into coats.

The two brave parents travel through cold forests, dark roads, and dangerous places to find the mansion. When they finally reach it, they reunite with their puppies and realize there are far more than they expected. Pongo and Perdita decide they will save every single one, not just their own. With clever teamwork, they lead all the puppies out of the mansion and escape into the snowy night while Cruella chases them in a rage.

After a long and risky journey home, they return to Roger and Anita's house. The humans are shocked but overjoyed to see the entire group of puppies safe. Instead of sending them away, Roger and Anita choose to keep them all, creating a big, happy family of 101 dalmatians. The story ends with everyone safe, Cruella defeated, and the house filled with love, laughter, and a lot of spots.
