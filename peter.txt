Peter Pan tells the story of a boy who lives in Neverland, a magical place where children never grow up. One night in London, Peter Pan visits the Darling family's nursery to look for his shadow. There he meets Wendy, John, and Michael, three curious children who dream of adventure. With a little help from Tinker Bell's fairy dust, Peter teaches them how to fly, and together they soar out the window and travel all the way to Neverland.

When they arrive, the children discover a world filled with excitement. They meet the Lost Boys, fight playful battles, and explore forests, lagoons, and pirate ships. But the peace never lasts long, because Captain Hook, Peter Pan's old enemy, is determined to capture Peter and anyone close to him. Hook holds a deep grudge because Peter once cut off his hand and fed it to a crocodile. Ever since then, the crocodile has been following Hook everywhere, waiting for another bite.

As the story unfolds, Wendy begins acting like a mother figure to the Lost Boys, while Peter keeps leading them into wild adventures. Captain Hook becomes more dangerous and eventually kidnaps Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys, planning to force them to walk the plank. Peter Pan arrives just in time. With quick thinking and courage, he fights Hook in a final showdown on the pirate ship. The crocodile appears again, and Hook, terrified and defeated, falls into the water and disappears.

With Hook gone, the children are finally safe. Wendy, John, and Michael decide it's time to return home, and Peter takes them back to London. He promises that he will never forget them, even though he chooses to stay in Neverland forever. The Darling children wake up in their nursery with memories of flight, magic, and a boy who never grows up. The story ends with Peter Pan flying back to Neverland, free, fearless, and forever young.
