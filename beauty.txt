Sleeping Beauty tells the story of Princess Aurora, a baby girl born to a joyful king and queen who have waited many years for a child. To celebrate her birth, they invite everyone in the kingdom, including three good fairies named Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather. Each fairy blesses Aurora with a magical gift: beauty, grace, and a gentle spirit. But the celebration is interrupted when Maleficent, a powerful and vengeful sorceress, arrives uninvited. Angry about being forgotten, she curses the baby. She declares that before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday, the princess will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep so deep that she will never wake.

Merryweather cannot fully undo the curse, but she softens it. Instead of dying, Aurora will fall asleep until she is awakened by true love's kiss. To protect the princess, the fairies take her into the forest and raise her as a simple girl named Briar Rose. Aurora grows up kind, gentle, and unaware of her true identity. She loves nature, sings with the birds, and dreams of love. One day, she meets a young man in the woods — Prince Phillip — though neither of them knows who the other really is. They feel an instant connection and promise to meet again.

Meanwhile, Maleficent spends years searching for Aurora. On her sixteenth birthday, Aurora returns to the castle, believing she is meeting her family. But Maleficent lures her into a hidden room where a spinning wheel stands waiting. Mesmerized by dark magic, Aurora touches the spindle and falls into an enchanted sleep, fulfilling the curse. Heartbroken, the king and queen watch as the fairies place Aurora on a bed of roses, casting a spell over the entire kingdom so everyone sleeps until the princess awakens.

When the fairies learn that the man Aurora met in the forest is Prince Phillip, they realize he is the one who must save her. But Maleficent has already captured him, determined to keep the kingdom trapped in eternal sleep. With the fairies' help, Phillip escapes and battles his way to the castle. Maleficent transforms into a giant dragon, blocking his path in a fierce final battle. With bravery and the fairies' magic, Phillip defeats her and reaches Aurora's tower.

He gently kisses her, breaking the curse and waking the entire kingdom. Aurora opens her eyes to see her true love standing before her. The castle fills with joy and music as the princess and prince reunite with their families. The story ends with Aurora and Phillip dancing together, surrounded by light, hope, and the promise of a bright future — a reminder that love and courage can overcome even the darkest magic.
